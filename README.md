# LeagueChampCounters
Tool that lets you enter a League of Legends champion and shows you the best and worst matchup. Scrapes from u.gg

The code for this is probably pretty bad, but I worked on this as a project to get better at python. Simple UI, just input champion name and it will show you the best and worst matchups.

Must run the scraper first to fill the matchups.xlsx file. At some point I'll do this myself and reupload, but for now it needs to be populated. 
You also must have the matchups.xlsx file in the same folder as the scripts as the script can't create it by itself, and I cba figuring out how to make it do so.
